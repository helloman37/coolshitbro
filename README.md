Edit: Download, TWRP.rar and extract it to the root of your SD CARD. After you have done that open the TWRP recovery
on your nintendo switch, then click Wipe, and Wipe EVERYTHING. Then hit back and click restore.
Select your sdcard from Select Storage and restore everything from the TWRP RAR file.

Also note, TIVIMATE will look rather "small" when the Nintendo Switch is Docked to the TV. Force close the app, and it will fix it'self. :) 

It has been done for you, just follow the steps.

At first I wanted to make this available for any android device. What is better than to have it on a gaming system.
This process is less than painful, and a lot painless than the origional method I wanted to use.
Everything is preselected to make this a smooth process.

Note: This should work on any rooted android device. We will be working with Switchroot, Nintendo Switch Android.

I have added the current Tivimate APK just incase they find this out, and rig it more. I have made Auto Update to be disabled. DO NOT update the app.


Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything you do, or may do to your Nintendo Switch.

Prerequisite:
I had used a 16 gb sd card for this process, you may be able to use a larger one, you can try.

How to install Switchroot onto The Nintendo Switch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGteGZ7lcXE

All that you need is to start the process, after you flash the Android partitions from Hekate, then load into TWRP, from there then finish the install.

Note: This is for The Nintendo Switch, no other device had been tested. (You must have a jailbroken switch).
Install Switchroot Android.

To try on another device follow below:
Install Aptoid, then download Root Explorer (After you have rooted your Switchroot). Grand root permissions.

Download the Tivimate Zip (https://bit.ly/tivimateman2) is given to you. Then open up Root Explorer to extract all the files from within the zip archive to /data/data/ar.tvplayer.tv

When you use Root Explorer, it will extract the contents to: /storage/emulated/0/SpeedSoftware/Extracted Go into that folder, copy all folders then go into the root folder, /data/data/ar.tvplayer.tv and paste the files there, replace everything. Make sure tivimate is closed before this. Once it had replaced everything, reopen tivimate and all should be unlocked.

Everything should be working great by the time you had done all that is shown here in this guide.

This should activate everything to be used within the app.


Q/A

(1) My Joy-cons do not work un-attached, what should I do?

A: Go into the blutooth settings on either image, and pair them. After that, they will work detached.

(2) Will this method work on future releases of Tivimate?

A: Will be determined when one is released, by theory it will work no problem.

(3) Will you provide any tv channels?

A: No

(5) I do not have the Google play Store, WTF?

A: Google Apps tend to slow down the switch, if you want GApps, please refer to the videos for this. I compiled these images, without GApps.
This allows the system to run smooth.

(6) Where can I get channels?

A: Google is your friend. (Or is it? ;))

Controls:

B - Select

Long Press B - Opens Options

Up, Down Arrow Keys Channel Change

A - Back

House Button - Home Screen

Aptoid is pre-installed to both images, this ensures smoother functionality when installing apps.

Try this with the Joy-con grip, feels very nice, and confertable.

After you had done all of this, try hooking up a Flash Drive to the outside of the Switch Dock. ;) Extended storage for your Tivimate DVR! :) 

When booting up your nintendo switch, make sure to boot it without it being connected to the Dock. After full boot, then place it in the Dock.
If you had used a flash drive for extended storage, it will still work after you placed the Switch into the Dock.


Bye, bye now. Enjoy!
