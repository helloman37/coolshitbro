Edit: Download, TWRP.rar and extract it to the root of your SD CARD. After you have done that open the TWRP recovery
on your nintendo switch, then click Wipe, and Wipe EVERYTHING. Then hit back and click restore.
Select your sdcard from Select Storage and restore everything from the TWRP RAR file.

Also note, TIVIMATE will look rather "small" when the Nintendo Switch is Docked to the TV. Force close the app, and it will fix it'self. :) 

It has been done for you, just follow the steps.

At first I wanted to make this available for any android device. What is better than to have it on a gaming system.
This process is less than painful, and a lot painless than the origional method I wanted to use.
Everything is preselected to make this a smooth process.

Note: This should work on any rooted android device. We will be working with Switchroot, Nintendo Switch Android.

I have added the current Tivimate APK just incase they find this out, and rig it more. I have made Auto Update to be disabled. DO NOT update the app.


Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything you do, or may do to your Nintendo Switch.

Prerequisite:
I had used a 16 gb sd card for this process, you may be able to use a larger one, you can try.

How to install Switchroot onto The Nintendo Switch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGteGZ7lcXE

All that you need is to start the process, after you flash the Android partitions from Hekate, then load into TWRP, from there then finish the install.

Note: This is for The Nintendo Switch, no other device had been tested. (You must have a jailbroken switch).
Install Switchroot Android.


Everything should be working great by the time you had done all that is shown here in this guide.

This should activate everything to be used within the app.


Q/A

(1) My Joy-cons do not work un-attached, what should I do?

A: Go into the blutooth settings on either image, and pair them. After that, they will work detached.

(2) Will this method work on future releases of Tivimate?

A: Will be determined when one is released, by theory it will work no problem.

(3) Will you provide any tv channels?

A: No

(5) I do not have the Google play Store, WTF?

A: Google Apps tend to slow down the switch, if you want GApps, please refer to the videos for this. I compiled these images, without GApps.
This allows the system to run smooth.

(6) Where can I get channels?

A: Google is your friend. (Or is it? ;))

Controls:

B - Select

Long Press B - Opens Options

Up, Down Arrow Keys Channel Change

A - Back

House Button - Home Screen

Aptoid is pre-installed to both images, this ensures smoother functionality when installing apps.

Try this with the Joy-con grip, feels very nice, and confertable.

Bye, bye now. Enjoy!
