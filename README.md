At first I wanted to make this available for any android device. What is better than to have it on a gaming system.
This process is less than painful, and a lot painless than the origional method I wanted to use.
Everything is preselected to make this a smooth process. This will NOT be done for you.

I have added the current Tivimate APK just incase they find this out, and rig it more. I have made Auto Update to be disabled. DO NOT update the app.

Sometimes to learn, is to do it yourselves. I will however build a guide for you. That is below:

Remember reading is fundimental.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything you do, or may do to your Nintendo Switch.

Prerequisite:
I had used a 16 gb sd card for this process, you may be able to use a larger one, you can try.

Download this: 
TABLET VERSION: https://download.switchroot.org/android-10/icosa-tab-20210510-rel.zip

GApps can, and will slow down your Switch. Get this if you really want this, but it can slow you down.

(Remember, you will need to install Downloader for processes. Get it from the Google Play Store, it is free!)

Note: This is for The Nintendo Switch, no other device had been tested. (You must have a jailbroken switch).
Install Switchroot Android.

/data/data/ar.tvplayer.tv
is the folder we are working with.


Downlaoad and install the version 4.2.0 of TIVIMATE from: 
https://www.mediafire.com/file/j6qtf5x1ohriumd/tivimate_4201.apk/file
Short url: https://bit.ly/3HMKMYQ

After install, go into the app. This way it will enable the database within the file system. Fully close Tivimate.
Look at the opened windows, and make sure Tivimate is fully closed.

Install Aptoid, then download Root Explorer (After you have rooted your Switchroot).
Grand root permissions.

Download the Tivimate Zip (https://bit.ly/tivimateman2) is given to you. Then open up Root Explorer to extract
all the files from within the zip archive to /data/data/ar.tvplayer.tv

When you use Root Explorer, it will extract the contents to: /storage/emulated/0/SpeedSoftware/Extracted
Go into that folder, copy all folders then go into the root folder, /data/data/ar.tvplayer.tv and paste the files there, replace everything. Make sure tivimate
is closed before this. Once it had replaced everything, reopen tivimate and all should be unlocked.

Everything should be working great by the time you had done all that is shown here in this guide.

This should activate everything to be used within the app.

Download the zip to Switchroot, then extract it's contents to the folder specified above. 
Make sure Tivimate is closed durring this. 

Q/A
(1) How do I use Tivimate on my switch, it is buggy when I use the touchscreen. 
A: Use the joycons, dock the switch to the tv, all is good. (By now you should know how to use the joycons with Switchroot).
(2) Will this method work on future releases of Tivimate?
A: Will be determined when one is released, by theory it will work no problem.
(3) Will you provide any tv channels?
A: No
(5) I do not have the Google play Store, WTF?
A: Had you remembered to install it as described in the video?
(6) Where can I get channels?
A: Goodle is your friend.

Bye, bye now. Enjoy!
